# Calling a JSON API
#
# In this assignment you will write a Python program somewhat similar to http://www.py4e.com/code3/geojson.py. The
# program will prompt for a location, contact a web service and retrieve JSON for the web service and parse that
# data, and retrieve the first place_id from the JSON. A place ID is a textual identifier that uniquely identifies a
# place as within Google Maps. API End Points
#
# To complete this assignment, you should use this API endpoint that has a static subset of the Google Data:
#
# http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/json? This API uses the same parameter (address) as the Google API. This API also has
# no rate limit so you can test as often as you like. If you visit the URL with no parameters, you get "No
# address..." response. To call the API, you need to include a key= parameter and provide the address that you are
# requesting as the address= parameter that is properly URL encoded using the urllib.parse.urlencode() function as
# shown in http://www.py4e.com/code3/geojson.py
#
# Make sure to check that your code is using the API endpoint is as shown above. You will get different results from
# the geojson and json endpoints so make sure you are using the same end point as this autograder is using.
#
# Test Data / Sample Execution
#
# You can test to see if your program is working with a location of "South Federal University" which will have a
# place_id of "ChIJJ2MNmPl_bIcRt8t5x-X5ZhQ".
#
# $ python3 solution.py
# Enter location: South Federal University
# Retrieving http://...
# Retrieved 2290 characters
# Place id ChIJJ2MNmPl_bIcRt8t5x-X5ZhQ
# Turn In
#
# Please run your program to find the place_id for this location:
#
# RPI Make sure to enter the name and case exactly as above and enter the place_id and your Python code below. Hint:
# The first seven characters of the place_id are "ChIJfQn ..."
